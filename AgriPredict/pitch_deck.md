## Slide 1: The Crisis

> ❌ **1 in 5 people in sub-Saharan Africa is hungry.**  
>  
> 🌾 500 million smallholder farms produce 80% of food —  
> yet they **farm blind**, with no yield forecasts.  
>  
> 🔻 Result: Crop loss, poverty, wasted aid.

## Slide 2: The Gap

National yield reports:
- 📉 Released 6+ months after harvest  
- 🗺️ District-level? Rare.  
- 📱 Accessible to farmers? Never.

👉 Farmers guess. Markets react too late.

## Slide 4: How It Works

1. Pull **free data**: NDVI (Sentinel-2), Rain (CHIRPS), Soil (SoilGrids)
2. Run **lightweight ML model** (Random Forest)
3. Output: Yield + confidence + agronomic tip

🎯 **Performance**:  
- **MAE: 0.42 t/ha**  
- **R²: 0.86**  
- 3× more accurate than national averages
